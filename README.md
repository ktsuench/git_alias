Some shortcut commands for git

On Windows:
Go to local C: drive and look for a folder called SPB_Data. If there is no .gitconfig in there then place the .gitconfig file in there. If there is .gitconfig in there then add the contents of this file to that one. Keep in mind not to replace any existing commands or configs.
